Custom Banners provides a simple interface to upload several banners and show a random or specific one to each visitor, using a shortcode.

== Description ==
Custom Banners is a WordPress plugin that allows you to easily manage several banners (ads) and display them on the front end.

- Create Banners Once, and Reuse Them Throughout Your Website -
Use custom banners to create resuable banners that your whole team can use! Setup the banners once, and you'll be able to re-use them throughout the website. Best of all, if you need to make an update you can just make it once.

- Update Your Banners Without Touching Your Code -
Simply place a shortcode into the page where you'd like your banner to appear, and then you'll never have to edit that page again!

Instead, you'll be able to manage that banner right from the WordPress dashboard, uploading new banners and taking down old ones as you like. All without having to edit your pages.

- Easily Add Captions and Call-To-Action Buttons To Your Custom Banners -
Custom Banners lets you optionally specify a caption and a call-to-action text and URL for each banner, making your banners an effective way to drive visitors to your most important pages.

Use the captions to announce a new special, and use the call-to-action button to let your customers claim it right away.

- Rotate Between Several Banners with Banner Groups -
Custom Banners also gives you many options for rotating banners within a position. So you can specify several banners which belong to a Banner Group, and then the software will automatically rotate through the banners in the Banner Group. 

- Automatically Publish New Banners At A Specified Time -
Do you have a banner that's announcing a new special, but you want to hide it until the right time? No problem - with the Publish Time feature of Custom Banners you can setup your banner now, but not show it until the right time.
